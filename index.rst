   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome
=======

Find out how to send requests to our API, and what you can do with it.  
The API is in a beta state and does not expose every part of the application, but you can already 
do lots of very useful things with it! Query the department schedule, manage labels, work types, 
time off types, list shift trades and much more.

Read the :doc:`authentication` page where you can learn how we handle requests.

Head on over to the :doc:`resources` page to find out about the different API endpoints and their roles.
